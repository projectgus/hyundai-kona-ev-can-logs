# Kona EV CAN logs

Some CAN logs taken from various CAN buses of Hyundai Kona EV vehicles. To assist with reverse engineering and repurposing for EV conversions and other uses.

Log files are in the SavvyCAN "GVRET" CSV format.

## See also

* A DBC file derived mostly from these logs can be found at https://github.com/projectgus/kona-ev-dbc
* [This Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9jZafV9eZeBUnPQo7qQHbX2-_4qZfWfRVpidoF1owA/edit#gid=660740603) from 2018 (author unknown) is mostly about Diagnostic OBD2 PIDs, but includes a useful diagram of the vehicle CAN bus architecture showing all the buses connected to the CAN gateway ("CGW" in the diagram, Hyundai seems to more typically call it the Integrated Gateway Power Module "IGPM").

## Vehicles

This repo contains logs from:

* 2019 Kona EV Highlander (crashed). Has VESS & Active Air Flap System missing from P-CAN (connector broken).
* 2021 Kona EV Highlander (crashed).
* 2020 Kona (not crashed, for heater log).

## Logs

Numbers `TS nnn` are log timestamps in seconds, correlated from videos or notes. Approximate only.

Many logs have accompanying videos that I haven't put in the repo (too big). If you're unsure about what happens at a particular time then you can open an Issue and ask me to check the video, I'll see what I can do.

Many of these logs become intermittent part way through due to consistently dropped messages, some kind of capturing issue. [More details in this blog post](https://www.projectgus.com/2023/10/kona-can-decoding/#bad-logs). There are notes below about if/when this seems to happen in each log.

### 221207-1-2019-pcan-dcan-vehicle-ready-scancodes-custompids.csv
Model: 2019

(Log has no dropped messages.)

Channel 0: PCAN, Channel 1: DCAN with an OBD2 BT dongle attached.

Vehicle is Powered On and Ready for the entire log.

First running a DTC scan in the [Torque Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque&gl=US) Android app for fault codes (none found by Torque, seems it doesn't support the Kona's diagnostics interface).

Starting around TS 337, running the [custom PIDs for Kona](https://github.com/JejuSoul/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/tree/master/Hyundai%20Kona%20EV%20&%20Kia%20Niro%20EV/extendedpids) monitoring values and scrolling through the available values (working).

### 221207-2-2019-pcan-dcan-vehicle-on-off-change-gears.csv

Connecting to a DC fast charger while a charging system fault was present (charge
plug socket control connector had been unplugged in the engine bay.)

(TS1890, log becomes intermittent)

Channel 0: PCAN, Channel 1: CCAN

Stationary vehicle. Messing about in the head unit Settings menu changing a bunch of settings (drive
modes, heads up display position, etc). However accidentally didn't video this
one, so no reference timestamps.

contain anything relevant (unknown).

### 230606-1-2021-epcu-control-board-only.csv

(The log does not appear to become intermittent.)

This log is from a third vehicle, not the same as the other two. It's from only the EPCU control board removed from the EPCU unit and powered on the bench (no connections to gate driver board or resolver.)

Power supplied to the power input pins (12V to large pins 47 & 48, 12V to small pin 46 for ignition/on, GND to 16.)

CAN connections:

* P-CAN pins 9 & 10 (H & L). This P-CAN bus is active but didn't send any messages in this configuration.
